# portfolio
A portfolio project with HTML and CSS to follow a strict design from FIGMA. Needs to contain responsiveness, crossbrowser testing and accessibility.

My approach was to start with the most time consuming part, the project section, as that section contains a great mix of images, headers, styling and position. Moving further down in the site and finally doing the top sections. I followed the mobile version in FIGMA strictly. As no tablet size advised in FIGMA - I did that measurements by calculating and testing.

Finally doing the cross browser testing and the accessibility testing check with wave.webaim.org. 
In order to get it more accessible I did refactor the a tags to wrap the whole area of icons making it more accessible to click than only the small iconfigures in the middle.

If I had more time, I would have spent more time to refactor my code in an even shorter way and also made it even more accessible.
